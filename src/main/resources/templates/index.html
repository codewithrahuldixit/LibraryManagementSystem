           Online Library Management System is a system which maintains the information
about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom
books are issued, library staff and all. This is very difficult to organize manually.
Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task.
Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an Online Library becomes
much simple. The Online Library Management has been designed to computerize and
automate the operations performed over the information about the members, book
issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of library helps in
many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of management as most of
the manual work done is reduced
